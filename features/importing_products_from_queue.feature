  As a Store Owner
  I want to import products from Akeneo PIM queue

  @cli
  Scenario: Importing single product model and its variants from queue
    Given the store operates on a single channel
    And the store is also available in "it_IT"
    And there is one item to import with identifier "braided-hat-m" for the "Product" importer in the Akeneo queue
    And there is one item to import with identifier "braided-hat-l" for the "Product" importer in the Akeneo queue
    When I import all items in queue
    Then the product "model-braided-hat" should exists with the right data
    And the product variant "braided-hat-m" of product "model-braided-hat" should exists with the right data
    And the product variant "braided-hat-l" of product "model-braided-hat" should exists with the right data

    When I import all items in queue
    Then the product "NOT_EXISTS" should not exists
    And the queue item with identifier "NOT_EXISTS" for the "Product" importer has not been marked as imported
    And the queue item with identifier "NOT_EXISTS" for the "Product" importer has an error message
