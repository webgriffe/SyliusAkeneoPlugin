  Scenario: Import product associations for already existent products
    Given the store operates on a single channel
    And the store has a product "10627329"
    And the store has a product "upsell-product-1" with code "upsell-product-1"
    And the store has a product "upsell-product-2" with code "upsell-product-2"
    And there is one product associations to import with identifier "10627329" in the Akeneo queue
    And the store has a product association type "Upsell" with a code "UPSELL"
    When I consume the messages
    Then the product "10627329" should be associated to product "upsell-product-1" for association with code "UPSELL"
    And the product "10627329" should be associated to product "upsell-product-2" for association with code "UPSELL"
